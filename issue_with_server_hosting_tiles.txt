As on the server side where "www.dronedeploy.com" hasnt been white listed on host server 'https://public-tiles.dronedeploy.com/f665b7b054_DNMANGEOPENPIPELINE_ortho_mwm/', so on generating whole pdf gives CORS issue. So i created node server to read the value of tile pngs separately. At least for now I can generate pdf of separate tiles. Once the drone deploy domain is whitelisted I can send you the code which generates the map as whole. 

Please See the attached mail chain in the directory to get overview of the issue.

Methods attempted to solve it:
1) using leaflet and leaflet-image to convert tiles into image , Same issue as above
2) usinf leaflet and DomToImage to convert tiles into image or directly into pdf, Same issue as above.
